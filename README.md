# Dark-Kitchen

A BeCode group project. The goal was to display a collection of objects in pure javascript, but we also added some shopping cart mechanics. The real challenge here was the team play side of things

Here is the github page : https://objectifguitare.github.io/Dark-Kitchen/

My contribution to this project was the dynamic display of the whole menu, the shopping cart's logic as well as the filtering. However, I decline all responsibilities concerning the actual appearance of this website.
